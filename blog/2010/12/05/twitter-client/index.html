<p>Does the world really need another Twitter client? It seems to be a real problem. Everybody has a different
idea of how it should work. What I envision would have even less UI than Tweetie, but would support several
use-cases that are important to me. Tweetie 2, if it ever happens, would fix retweets, which would probably
be enough to satisfy me.</p>

<p>Or I could write it. I&#8217;m definitely interested in starting another Objective-C project, but I don&#8217;t know if
this is really what I want to do. I&#8217;d gain more by fixing Fireworks than Tweetie.</p>
