<div class="entry-content"><p>We haved switched to Ruby 1.9.2 for all new projects, and have been using RVM to manage the switch between those
new projects and legacy projects that are on 1.8.7. We have also been using Bundler to manage gem dependencies for
all projects, regardless of Ruby or Rails versions. I have run into a number of issues, and ambiguities with this
combination of tools, and could not find adequate explanation for how they were to be used together. So I pieced
together as much information as I could, and I think I now have a pretty clear picture of the state of things.
This post is an attempt to summarize those findings.</p>

<p>These are some of the questions that arose:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should we check the <code>.rvmrc</code> file into source control?</li>
<li>Should we specify a patch level in <code>.rvmrc</code>?</li>
<li>Should we specify a gemset in <code>.rvmrc</code>?</li>
<li>Should we use RVM gemsets for each project? Why does this matter when we&#8217;re using Bundler?</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m going to go ahead and assume that you know why you would want to use RVM rather than, say, MacPorts to install Ruby.
I&#8217;m also going to assume that you can find the Bundler docs, which clearly explain why you should check in both <code>Gemfile</code>
and <code>Gemfile.lock</code>, even though that was actually another question that came up for us.</p>

<h3>Checking in .rvmrc</h3>

<p>I was hesitant about this at first, because not everyone on the team had moved to using RVM, but I think it is the only
sane thing to do. At the very least, it provides documentation of which version of Ruby the application will run against.
It most likely will be the only place this is actually declared in the project. Everyone doing professional development
work in Ruby needs to move to RVM on their development machines so that we can migrate to 1.9.2. There&#8217;s really no way
around it.</p>

<h3>Patch levels</h3>

<p>When you install a version of Ruby with RVM, it will install the latest patch level that it knows about. If you specify
the version of Ruby in your <code>.rvmrc</code> without a patch level, it will use that version of Ruby. When you upgrade RVM, it will
possibly know about a later patch level of Ruby, and consider that to be the version specified in your <code>.rvmrc</code>, and complain
that the specified version is not installed.</p>

<p>So if you don&#8217;t specify a patch level, you will have to upgrade Ruby and rebuild your gemsets if you upgrade RVM. This can
be annoying. On the other hand, it seems to me that if you do specify the latest patch level, and you are working on a
variety of projects over many months, you will end up with each project running on a separate install of Ruby, unless you
take pains to keep each of them up to date. Or perhaps you will start each project by copying the <code>.rvmrc</code> file from the
previous project, and never progress to later versions. Obviously, specifying a new patch level will force everyone to
upgrade RVM, which will possibly invalidate the Ruby version they are using for other projects that do not specify a
patch level.</p>

<p>Another argument I heard was that some hosting companies (in this case EngineYard) document their language support down
to the patch level, and I think I agree that it would make sense to specify it if you are deploying to such an environment.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t tell which of these options are better. At RoleModel we&#8217;ve opted to not include the patch level, and people can
deal with RVM upgrades on their own. It seems to be the better solution for lazy people.</p>

<h3>Specifying a gemset</h3>

<p>I really wish that you could specify a version of Ruby in the <code>.rvmrc</code>, but allow the individual programmer to choose a gemset
for the project in a separate file, that could be ignored by git. The problem is that if you don&#8217;t specify a gemset, the
gems get installed into the non-gemset gemset, if that makes sense. It&#8217;s almost like a default or unnamed gemset. The result
is that you really end up specifying where to install the gems whether you meant to or not. There is no flexibility here for
an individual developer to decide what to use on his own machine.</p>

<p>In a team scenario, I think it is important to agree on how to manage gemsets. Insofar as gemsets only affect the machine that
they are on, I wish this could be a matter of personal preference, but because they have to be specified in the <code>.rvmrc</code>, and
since we already decided that we were going to check in <code>.rvmrc</code>, it seems necessary that all members of the team use gemsets
in the same way on all development machines.</p>

<h3>Project-specific gemsets</h3>

<p>Bundler basically handles loading the right versions of all the right gems for your application. Why then would you want to
keep a separate gemset for each project? Well, there are some reasons to do so, and perhaps some reasons not to, and unfortunately,
for the reason explained above, this is not really a personal decision.</p>

<p>The reasons I found to use separate gemsets are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your shell environment is the same as your application environment (no <code>bundle exec</code>).</li>
<li>You can easily browse and grep through the source code of all your dependencies, by navigating to the gemset install directory.</li>
<li>It prevents some reported &#8216;heisenbugs&#8217;, according to the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wayneeseguin/status/24507569355628544">author of RVM</a>. I wonder if this is related to number 1.</li>
</ol>


<p>The only reason I know of to keep them together is disk space, which is only really a concern for early adopters of SSDs (like myself).
It&#8217;s also kind of moot once you understand what&#8217;s going on with patch levels. If you aren&#8217;t anal about keeping all your projects
on the latest patch level then you are going to end up with poorly named <em>de facto</em> gemsets for each project anyway.</p>

<p>The other issue that you need to understand in making a decision is that the <code>@global</code> gemset gets inherited by all other gemsets on the
machine (within the same version of Ruby). Because of this, if you use <code>@global</code> for your application, you will interfere with
any other application on the same machine trying to have a complete set of dependencies in a project-specific gemset. For example, if you
were to install Rails 3.0.3 in the <code>@global</code> gemset for one application, and another application where to install the same version of Rails
in a separate gemset for that application, the Rails gem itself would be installed again, but it would resolve all of it&#8217;s dependencies,
such as ActiveRecord and ActionPack, through <code>@global</code>, and would not install separate versions of them.</p>

<p>So for the sake of playing nice with others, I think it would be better to use something like <code>@shared</code> if you want to use a common gemset
between projects. I also think that there are three good reasons to use project-specific gemsets, but none of them really affect
the project as a whole, which is why I would prefer that it was a matter of preference rather than team policy.</p>

<h3>Bonus: the proper use of @global</h3>

<p>One bit of advise I thought made a lot of sense was to install Bundler itself in the <code>@global</code> gemset. I think this would also be
a good place for utility gems such as <code>gemedit</code> that do not need to be loaded into the application environment at all, but you would
like to have in your shell environment.</p>
